# Technical Design Document for JustSplit

## Overview

This document outlines the technical design of the JustSplit application, detailing the technologies, frameworks, and libraries chosen for the project, along with justifications for their selection.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React
  - **Justification**: React is chosen for its component-based architecture, which promotes reusability and maintainability. It also has a large ecosystem and community support.

- **State Management**: Redux
  - **Justification**: Redux is used for managing application state in a predictable way, making it easier to debug and test the application.

- **Styling**: CSS Modules / Styled Components
  - **Justification**: CSS Modules provide a modular approach to styling, preventing class name collisions. Styled Components allow for dynamic styling based on component state.

### Backend

- **Serverless Functions**: AWS Lambda / Netlify Functions
  - **Justification**: Serverless architecture allows for easy scaling and reduced operational overhead. It is cost-effective for handling backend logic without managing servers.

- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
  - **Justification**: Firestore is a NoSQL database that provides real-time data synchronization, making it suitable for collaborative applications like JustSplit.

### APIs

- **Payment Integration**: PayPal API / Venmo API (planned)
  - **Justification**: These APIs will facilitate seamless payment processing within the application, enhancing user experience.

## Architecture

### Client-Side Architecture

- The client-side application will be structured into components, with a clear separation of concerns. Each component will handle its own state and UI logic, while global state will be managed by Redux.

### Data Flow

- Data will flow from the client to the serverless functions, which will handle business logic and interact with the Firestore database. The client will receive updates in real-time through Firestore's built-in capabilities.

## Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: End-to-end encryption will be implemented to ensure that user financial data remains private.
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication will be used to manage user sign-ups and logins securely.

## Conclusion

The technical design of JustSplit leverages modern technologies and best practices to create a robust, scalable, and user-friendly application for managing shared expenses. This design will facilitate future enhancements and ensure a smooth user experience.
