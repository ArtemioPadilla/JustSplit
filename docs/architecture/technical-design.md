# Technical Design Document for JustSplit

## Overview

This document outlines the technical design of the JustSplit application, detailing the technologies, frameworks, and libraries chosen for the project, along with justifications for their selection.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **Framework**: Next.js
  - **Justification**: Next.js is chosen for its built-in optimizations, server-side rendering capabilities, and support for static site generation. The App Router provides a more intuitive file-based routing system with support for layouts, loading states, and error handling.

- **Language**: TypeScript
  - **Justification**: TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, providing better code quality, enhanced IDE support, and early error detection, which is crucial for maintaining a robust codebase.

- **State Management**: React Context API with hooks / Zustand
  - **Justification**: For simpler state management needs, React's built-in Context API is sufficient. For more complex requirements, Zustand provides a lightweight yet powerful alternative to Redux with better TypeScript integration.

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS / CSS Modules
  - **Justification**: Tailwind CSS enables rapid UI development with utility classes, while CSS Modules provide component-scoped styling to prevent class name collisions.

### Data Management

- **Client-Side Data Fetching**: SWR / React Query
  - **Justification**: These libraries provide optimized data fetching with caching, revalidation, and synchronization features, enhancing the user experience with real-time updates.

- **Local Storage**: Persistence Layer
  - **Justification**: A custom persistence layer with encryption will be used to store user data in the browser's local storage, ensuring data privacy and offline functionality.

### APIs

- **Payment Integration**: PayPal API / Venmo API (planned)
  - **Justification**: These APIs will facilitate seamless payment processing within the application, enhancing user experience.

## Architecture

### Next.js App Router Architecture

- The application will use the Next.js App Router, which provides a file-system based routing where directories define routes.
- Each route can have specialized files like `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, and `error.tsx` to manage different aspects of the UI.
- Server components will be used for data fetching and initial rendering, while client components will handle interactive elements.

### Data Flow

- Data will flow from the client to server components for initial rendering, with client-side components taking over for interactive features.
- SWR or React Query will manage client-side data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the local storage.

## Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: End-to-end encryption will be implemented to ensure that user financial data remains private in local storage.
- **Input Validation**: Zod schema validation will be used to validate all user inputs both on the client and server sides.

## TypeScript Implementation

- Strict TypeScript configuration will be enforced to catch potential errors at compile time.
- Interface and type definitions will be created for all data models to ensure type safety across the application.
- Generic types will be leveraged for reusable components and hooks to provide better type inference.

## Conclusion

The technical design of JustSplit leverages Next.js with App Router and TypeScript to create a robust, type-safe, and user-friendly application for managing shared expenses. This architecture provides better performance, developer experience, and code maintainability compared to traditional React applications.
