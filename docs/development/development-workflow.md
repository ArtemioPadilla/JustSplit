# Development Workflow

This document outlines the development workflow for the JustSplit project, detailing the processes and practices that contributors should follow to ensure a smooth and efficient development experience.

## Branching Strategy

1. **Main Branch**: The `main` branch contains the stable version of the application. All production-ready code should be merged into this branch.
2. **Development Branch**: The `develop` branch is used for ongoing development. Features and fixes should be merged into this branch before being integrated into the `main` branch.
3. **Feature Branches**: For each new feature or bug fix, create a separate branch from `develop`. Use a descriptive name for the branch, such as `feature/add-payment-integration` or `bugfix/fix-ui-issue`.

## Code Reviews

1. **Pull Requests**: Once a feature or fix is complete, submit a pull request (PR) to merge the feature branch into the `develop` branch.
2. **Review Process**: Other team members should review the PR, providing feedback and suggestions. Ensure that the code adheres to the project's coding standards.
3. **Approval**: Once the PR is approved by at least one other contributor, it can be merged into the `develop` branch.

## Testing

1. **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes to ensure code quality and functionality.
2. **Integration Tests**: Conduct integration tests to verify that different components of the application work together as expected.
3. **Continuous Integration**: Utilize a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes.

## Deployment Process

1. **Staging Environment**: Deploy the `develop` branch to a staging environment for further testing and validation.
2. **Production Deployment**: Once the features in the `develop` branch are stable and tested, merge them into the `main` branch. Deploy the `main` branch to the production environment.
3. **Versioning**: Follow semantic versioning for releases. Update the version number in the project files and create release notes for each deployment.

## Documentation

1. **Update Documentation**: Ensure that all relevant documentation is updated to reflect new features, changes, and fixes.
2. **Changelog**: Maintain a changelog to document significant changes and updates to the project.

## Communication

1. **Regular Meetings**: Hold regular meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and upcoming tasks.
2. **Issue Tracking**: Use an issue tracker to manage tasks, bugs, and feature requests. Assign issues to team members as needed.

By following this development workflow, contributors can collaborate effectively and maintain a high standard of quality in the JustSplit project.
