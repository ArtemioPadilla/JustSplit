## Comprehensive Refactoring Plan

### 1. Component Architecture Restructuring

Currently, your application has a mix of page components and reusable components, but there's opportunity to create a more modular structure:

1. **Create a UI Component Library**
   - Move all reusable UI components to a dedicated `/components/ui` directory
   - Extract common patterns (buttons, cards, inputs, etc.) into their own components

2. **Feature-based Organization**
   - Group components by feature (events, expenses, settlements, etc.)
   - Each feature should have its own directory with domain-specific components

3. **Shared Layouts**
   - Create layout components for consistent page structures
   - Implement consistent header, footer, and navigation components

### 2. Styling Architecture

1. **CSS Module Consolidation**
   - Create a base styles directory with theme variables
   - Establish a component-specific vs. global styles separation
   - Implement a design system with consistent spacing, colors, typography

2. **Design System Implementation**
   - Define a set of design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
   - Create a theme provider for consistent styling across the application
   - Document the design system for future development

### 3. State Management Refactoring

1. **Context Optimization**
   - Split the AppContext into domain-specific contexts (EventsContext, ExpensesContext)
   - Implement context selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders

2. **Data Management**
   - Introduce data fetching hooks for each domain
   - Separate read/write operations into distinct functions
   - Add proper error handling and loading states

### 4. Utilities and Helpers

1. **Utility Function Organization**
   - Create domain-specific utility files (eventUtils, expenseUtils, etc.)
   - Move calculation functions from components to utility files
   - Implement proper typing for all utilities

2. **Common Helpers**
   - Extract date formatting and manipulation to dedicated helpers
   - Create currency and amount formatting utilities
   - Implement reusable calculation functions

### 5. Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test all utility functions and helpers
   - Create tests for individual components

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interactions between components
   - Verify context and state management

## Timeline and Progress Component Refactoring Plan

Now, let's focus specifically on the timeline and progress functionality that you want to implement first:

### 1. Create Reusable Timeline Component

1. **Extract Timeline Component**
   - Create a new component at index.tsx
   - Move the timeline-related JSX and styles from page.tsx
   - Make it accept props for events, expenses, and callbacks

2. **Timeline Utils**
   - Create a new file at `/utils/timelineUtils.ts`
   - Move calculation functions:
     - `calculateTimelineProgress`
     - `calculatePositionPercentage`
     - `groupNearbyExpenses`

3. **Timeline Styling**
   - Create styles at styles.module.css
   - Extract all timeline-related styles from page.module.css

### 2. Create Progress Component

1. **Extract Progress Component**
   - Create a new component at index.tsx
   - Move progress-related JSX from page.tsx
   - Make it accept props for value, label, and appearance

2. **Progress Styling**
   - Create styles at styles.module.css
   - Extract all progress-related styles

### 3. Create Expense Card Component

1. **Extract HoverCard Component**
   - Create a new component at index.tsx
   - Move expense hover card JSX and functionality
   - Make it reusable across the application

2. **HoverCard Styling**
   - Create styles at styles.module.css
   - Extract relevant styles

### 4. Implementation Steps

1. **Create the component files**
   - Set up the directory structure
   - Create TypeScript interfaces for all component props
   - Add proper exports

2. **Move and refactor code**
   - Extract the functionality from the event list page
   - Refactor to use props instead of direct context access

3. **Apply to other pages**
   - Update page.tsx to use the new components
   - Add timeline visualization to page.tsx
   - Ensure consistent appearance across the application

4. **Cleanup and testing**
   - Remove duplicate code
   - Add unit tests for the new components
   - Test all pages that use the new components

### 5. Additional Enhancements

1. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Add ARIA attributes to interactive elements
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
   - Add proper focus management

2. **Animation Enhancements**
   - Add subtle animations for timeline interactions
   - Implement smooth transitions for progress bars

## Implementation Plan for First Steps

To begin the refactoring as you requested, here's a detailed implementation plan:

1. **Create the Timeline and ProgressBar components**
2. **Move utility functions to a dedicated file**
3. **Update the event list page to use the new components**
4. **Apply the components to the event detail page**
5. **Test and ensure consistency**

Would you like me to start implementing these components for you? I can begin by creating the Timeline component and moving the relevant styles and functionality.
