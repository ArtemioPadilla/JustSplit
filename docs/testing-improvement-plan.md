# JustSplit Testing Improvement Plan

## Current Status

Based on the test report, we currently have 18 failing test suites with 0 passing tests. The primary issues appear to be:

1. Missing test utilities for properly rendering components with context
2. Outdated test assertions that don't match component implementations
3. Missing mock implementations for external dependencies
4. Incomplete test coverage for core application functionality

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Fix Failing Tests

#### Context Tests
- ✅ Implemented `AppContext.test.tsx` to verify context initialization and state updates
- Test the reducer functions for all action types

#### Component Tests
- Update all Dashboard component tests using `renderWithAppContext`
- Add proper initialization data that matches component expectations
- Ensure components are tested with realistic props

#### Utility Tests
- Fix currency exchange and CSV export tests with proper mocks
- Add test cases for edge cases in the expense calculator

### 2. Testing Architecture Improvements

#### Test Utilities
- ✅ Created `renderWithAppContext` utility for consistent context rendering
- ✅ Created test data generators for common test scenarios
- Add more specialized test helpers for:
  - Event handling
  - Form submission
  - Navigation testing

#### Configuration
- ✅ Updated Jest configuration with appropriate module mappers
- ✅ Added comprehensive mock implementation for Next.js router and other dependencies
- Implement proper snapshot testing setup

## Best Practices

### Component Testing
- Test each component in isolation
- Provide realistic props that match production scenarios
- Test both default and edge case behaviors
- Verify DOM updates in response to user interactions
- Use data-testid attributes for consistent element selection

### Context Testing
- Verify initial state values
- Test each action type and reducer separately
- Verify complex state transitions
- Test integration with UI components

### Utility Testing
- Test each utility function in isolation
- Cover edge cases and error conditions
- Mock external dependencies consistently

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Tests (1-2 weeks)
1. Fix AppContext tests
2. Fix core component tests (Header, Dashboard components)
3. Fix utility tests (expense calculator, currency exchange)

### Phase 2: Expand Test Coverage (2-3 weeks)
1. Add tests for all remaining components
2. Add integration tests for key user flows
3. Implement end-to-end tests for critical paths

### Phase 3: Automated Testing (Ongoing)
1. Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline
2. Set up coverage reporting and monitoring
3. Establish testing standards for new code

## Tools & Libraries

- **Testing Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Mocking**: Jest mocks, MSW for API mocking
- **End-to-End**: Cypress or Playwright (to be added)
- **Reporting**: Jest HTML Reporter (already configured)

## Success Metrics

- Test coverage above 80% for all core functionality
- Zero failing tests in CI pipeline
- All new features accompanied by tests
- Reduced bug reports for tested functionality

## Conclusion

By systematically addressing the failing tests and implementing the strategies outlined above, we can establish a robust testing foundation for JustSplit. This will lead to higher code quality, fewer regressions, and a more maintainable codebase.
